Pokemon XYZ looking for team

Pokemon XYZ is a fresh, but ambitious new project of mine that seeks to
give the player a fresh new experience that is unlike other fangames they've
seen so far.

So what is this game going to be?

Gameplay:
- Instead of playing as a trainer, you play as different Pokemon themselves
- You don't catch Pokemon, you unlock them through story progression, challenges or sidequests
- focusses more on casual gameplay than intense challenge for the main story
- seeks to provide a new creative and subversive perspective on the traditional
Pokemon experience

The Story:
Pokemon are fed up with their oppression through mankind
