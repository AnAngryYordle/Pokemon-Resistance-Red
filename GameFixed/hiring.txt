Pokemon Resistance Red looking for team

Pokemon Resistance Red is a fresh, but ambitious new project of mine that seeks to
give the player a fresh new experience that is unlike other fangames they've
seen so far.

So what is this game going to be?

Gameplay:
- Instead of playing as a trainer, you play as different Pokemon themselves
- You don't catch Pokemon, you unlock them through story progression, challenges or sidequests
- focusses more on casual gameplay than intense challenge for the main story
- seeks to provide a new creative and subversive perspective on the traditional
Pokemon experience
- Should give plenty opportunity for sidequests, sideobjectives and unlockables
- Based on Fire Red/Leaf Green

The Story:
You play a young Pokemon growing up in a small Pokemon settlement that is getting
increasingly frustrated with their oppression through trainers and humanity in general.
Slowly you start gathering an army of Pokemon willing to fight for freedom and take on
humanity. On its way you're going to see Kanto (possibly other regions lateron) with additional
areas hidden from the trainers eyes as well as different factions striving for different goals
within a grand Pokemon revolution

The Development Process:
- I'm trying to keep the development process as professional as I can with my limited experience :)
- Development using Pokemon Essentials v20.1
- Use of the Kanban project management technique via Clickup
- Use of Github for version control
- Use of Discord for communication
- Creativity is welcome
- Any degree of involvement is welcome. Whether you just like to make small creative contributions
once in a while or want to put lots of work into this: you're welcome

What should you bring?
- Holding yourself and your work to a high standard
- Solid communication skills (for example telling if there's delays, being nice to people, no bullying,
gossiping etc, no discrimination or bigotry)
- healthy criticism and self-criticism skills
- Solid skills in the English language
- and most importantly: Passion for what you're doing

What is the team going to look like?
- so far I've been working alone
- I will be doing mapping, project management, creative directing, Events, storywriting, PBS editing
- Depending on if it ends up being required I can also take on producing soundtrack and coding
- I am looking especially for people skilled in graphics/art, game design and balancing, storywriting and
writing events
- I'll take help in any other field as well though :)

What is the current state of the project?
- basic ressources have been imported for gen 1-9 Pokemon
- about half of the Kanto overworld maps have been recreated
- Kanban board has been set up
- all Gen 1 Pokemon have been added to trainer_types and metadata PBS

I hope I could convince you of my pitch. If you want to contribute or even just follow the project, feel free
